      <p>
        You begin your quest a new arrival in the village of Blackstone. A YOUNG LAD with a large satchel of GOLD and flask of some unknown POTION looks up to you and asks:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hello, there! Would you like to try my potion? You won't regret it!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you TAKE GOLD or DRINK POTION?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <input size="50" placeholder="Type 'TAKE GOLD' or 'DRINK POTION'. Case sensitive!" id="response" />
      <button  onclick="goldOrPotion()">Submit</button>
      <p id="error"></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="gold" class="hidden">
    <div class="container text-background">
      <img src="images/dragon-fire-png.png" />
      <p>
        You take the GOLD, but the YOUNG LAD'S eyes turn completely black. He roars and transforms into a gigantic dragon and belches a ball of fire into the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        You promptly wet your pants. Before you can respond or even react, he lunges down at you and bites your head off.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are dead.

      <p>
        You drank the potion. A strange feeling erupts in your belly. You begin to swell to the size of a windmill, crushing everything and everyone in your path.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your body presses against a sharp steeple, you explode, showering the town of Blackstone with bits of yourself to the horror of absolutely no one, for they were all crushed by your girth.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are dead.
